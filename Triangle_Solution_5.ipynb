        "If the goal here is to find where a line will cross the fewest bricks, then we could also say that the goal is to find where the most brick edges line up. We can consider the edges to occur at an index representing the current running total of the previous elements of a given row of the wall. For example, if the row is defined as [1,2,2,1], then the inside edges occur at [1,1+2,1+2+2], or [1,3,5].\n",

        "\n",
        "Once we're done filling freq, we just need to iterate through it to find the highest value (best), which represents the number of edges aligned on a single index. Our actual answer, however, is the number of bricks, not edges, so we should return the total number of rows minus best."
